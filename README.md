## What's Parallel:

Multi-thread Approach: Queue-based task management with thread pool

Preemptive Execution: Tasks executed with threads in preemptive manner

Concurrent GitHub Webhook Processing: Multiple webhooks processed simultaneously

## Why Golang:

"Incredible parallel programming efficiency"

"Super-easy way to learn on the basis of C-like programming languages"

Built-in concurrency primitives make parallel execution straightforward
